Deployement 

1. first wee need create Ec2 instance 
 
2. in project settings set Debug = False

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["*"]

for example we got an error msg with database 
so fronted team can't see that error msg . beacause in that table names are there 
so we need set debug = false 
and middle wares also used for this 




we need to write logging file for project in settings

the importnacse of logging is it's tells the behavior of the appliation and it's helps the resolve issues while running the project 

creating logger 
import logging 
logger = loggin.getlogger(__name__)

in our functions or viewsets: 
   logger.info("")
   logger.debug("")
    logger.warn("")
   logger.error

3. install putty software 
5. login with user,host,port,keyvalue
6. write requirement.txt file in project folder 
7. copy code into puttysoftwre 
8. install required python version
9. insatll setup tools : sudo yum install python3-pip
10. install required dependincies : pip install -r requirement.txt
before runserver we nee add one security group with custom and port number 8000
11. runserver : make migrations , runserver at 0.0.0.0:8000

IN this process I have faced one issue. for dependencies install i not able to install mysqlclient . execpt that all dependenies are installed
